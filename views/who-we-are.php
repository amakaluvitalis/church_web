                All Saintsâ€™ Church Maseno is a Christ-centered Anglican community rooted in worship, discipleship, and service. 
                Our rich history traces back to early missionary work in Maseno, shaping our faith and traditions. 
                We embrace both spiritual and infrastructural growth, integrating modern technology in worship and evangelism while 
                fostering unity through ministries such as Sunday School, Youth Ministry, Mothers' Union, and Praise & Worship. 
                Guided by our 2024-2028 strategic plan, we are committed to faith-driven transformation, sustainability, and community service, 
                ensuring a lasting impact for generations to come.
